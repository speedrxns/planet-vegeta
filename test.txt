Proposal for Data Pipeline Enhancement
Objective
To optimize our data pipeline for Snowflake-based datasets, we propose incorporating a clause that prevents duplicate data from entering our system. This enhancement will be added to the end of our queries to ensure only new snapshot data is processed.

Implementation
We will implement the following SQL clause:

sql
Copy code
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM my_db m
    WHERE m.snapshot_dt = s.snapshot_dt
);
This clause checks if a snapshot date already exists in our system (my_db). If a match is found, the data is excluded from the processing pipeline, effectively preventing redundancy.

Technical Rationale
Performance Optimization: The use of NOT EXISTS with SELECT 1 is chosen for its efficiency. NOT EXISTS is generally more performant than alternatives like NOT IN, especially with larger datasets, as it allows for short-circuiting as soon as a match is found.

Snowflake Optimization: Leveraging Snowflake's automatic micro-partitioning and metadata caching, this approach minimizes the data scanned and enhances query execution speed. By filtering data at the source, we reduce the need for additional downstream processing.

Conclusion
By adopting this strategy, we ensure that our data pipeline remains efficient and reliable, avoiding the pitfalls of redundant data processing. This enhancement aligns with our commitment to maintaining high-performance data operations within Snowflake's optimized architecture.
